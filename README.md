Some functions for data preprocessing were taken from [this awesome tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-on-point-clouds-implementing-pointnet-in-google-colab-1fd65cd3a263).

**Final report** and progress reports can be found in _presentation/reports_ folder.

All the **architectures** discussed in the final report are in _autoencoder.ipynb_ document.

All the **data preprocessing and dataloaders** creation are in _helping_module_ and _data_processing.ipynb_.
